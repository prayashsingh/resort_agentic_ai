🏨 Resort Agentic AI System
A chat-based agentic AI system designed for a resort to autonomously handle guest requests across Reception, Restaurant, and Room Service using a single unified chat interface.
The system intelligently understands user intent, routes requests to the correct agent, maintains conversational context, performs actions via tools/APIs, persists data, and updates a live operations dashboard.
